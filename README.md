# CalorieTracker
Calorie Tracker is an app that allows you to keep track of how many calories you consume each day. Its convenience is in its ability to do this through SMS (text messages) so that even people with limited access to computers or smartphones are able to use it. Using it is super simple: just text the amount of calories you have eaten so far to the number below and it will respond quickly. **IMPORTANT: This does not yet work for all phone numbers. We are waiting to get our Twilio account upgraded.**

#### Text your calorie intake to (856) 314 5301.
